## How to run the code
1. Preprocess the data
```bash
$ wget http://atp-modelzoo-sh.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/datasets/mell/data.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf data.tar.gz
```

2. Run the initial learning stage of MeLL
```bash
$ sh run_mell_initial.sh
```

3. Run the lifelong learning stage of MeLL
```bash
$ sh run_mell_lifelong.sh
```
